CSS master:
In an online platform Cssbattle there will be a regular css solving puzzle;
I completed 15 among these daily battle puzzles.

I used internal css instead of inline and external css:
As Internal css is recommanded for single page 
I used ID to differentiate styling.
As mentioned in instructions I used only div tag.

margin,padding place a main role in giving a perfect output
for curves border properties are used
left,top,height,width are used to determine placement and length
background colour is used to change the backgroung colour of the page
position-absolute is used to seperate relativity
every page is set to 400px * 300px

This task helps to improve or masters our css skills and helps in logical thinking
