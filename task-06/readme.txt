DISCORD SERVER BOT:

Through this task I understand how a server bot works and functions
I understood the python code and assigned functions for friendly bot
as some specific feautres are given to the bot like:
if any negative word like villanious spam were used,then the bot disappears the messsage
By some external fuctions in discord and python code 
the friendly bot can manage the chat like disappearing,categorising the messages,give resources if shortcut is used,etc..

I understand the concpt of bots which we use regularly nowadays through this task
